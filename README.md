# StrataMind

**AI for Detecting Rare Minerals in Geological Data**

StrataMind is an open-source AI project designed to detect rare minerals and ores from geological survey images using deep learning and computer vision. It empowers geologists, researchers, and mining companies with intelligent mineral detection through modern AI tools.

---

## 🌍 Project Goals

- Detect rare minerals in geological image data.
- Provide a pre-trained AI model ready for inference.
- Enable researchers to train models with their own data.
- Showcase a real-time demo of mineral identification.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makalin/StrataMind.git
cd StrataMind
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Example Use

```python
from src.model import load_model, predict_mineral
from src.utils import load_image

model = load_model("models/stratamind_model.pt")
image = load_image("data/sample_rock.jpg")
result = predict_mineral(model, image)

print("Detected Mineral:", result)
```
